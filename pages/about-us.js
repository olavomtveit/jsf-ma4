        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
          <br /> Daily told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"
          <br /> Keep your battery charged
          <br /> You know it won't stick, yo
          <br /> And it's not his fault you kick slow
          <br /> Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
          <br /> Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
          <br /> And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
          <br /> The beat is so butter
          <br /> Peep the slow cutter
          <br /> As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
          <br /> Don't talk about my moms, yo
          <br /> Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
          <br /> Or vice versa
          <br /> Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
          <br /> Hit it on the first try
          <br />
          Villain: the worst guy
          <br /> Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
          <br />
          Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
          <br /> And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
          <br /> And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
          <br />
          Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
          <br /> Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
          <br /> It's ugly, like look at you
          <br /> It's a damn shame
          <br /> Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name
          <br /> And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
          <br /> I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
          <br /> All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
          <br /> And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
          <br />
          Allegedly, the investigation is still ongoing
          <br /> In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
          <br /> The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
          <br /> Madman never go pop like snot bubbles
        </p>
